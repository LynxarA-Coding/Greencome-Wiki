# [BCAB] Blaine Country Administrative Building

## Description:
Let's go through the RP and imagine the situation. It's 2022, the San Andreas government has been planning for a very long time to improve the country side,
Blaine County. And finally they decided to allocate a huge amount of money, having previously hired an architect to improve and rebuild the town of Sandy Shores.
Here's the beginning! The first building to be constructed was the Blaine Country Administrative Building. Next on the plan is the rest of the city üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
