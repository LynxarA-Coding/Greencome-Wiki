# INSTALLATION:

## FiveM

Before you put the map into "resources" folder, make sure that the games are set to "sv_enforceGameBuild 2545"
If not, put this line in your server.cfg 
After, you can put the gang_int to "resources" folder, then open server.cfg and add line "ensure gcom_ss_workshop".
Start the server and enjoy.


## Single Player

- Copy this folder into "mods/update/x64/dlcpacks"
- Then add the following link to the bottom of your dlclist.xml which is located at "mods/update.rpf/common/data"
     - <Item>dlcpacks:/gcom_sandy_workshop/</Item>
